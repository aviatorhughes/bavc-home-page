<h3>Group Sittings</h3>
<br />
<p><u>Group Sittings</u> are valuable opportunities to strengthen your practice of Vipassana. By sitting with fellow students who are following the same technique, you can meditate more seriously and gain support, which will help you keep practicing on your own.</p>

<h3>One-Day Courses</h3>

<p><u>One-Day Courses</u> are a wonderful opportunity to refresh and strengthen your practice, or to give Dhamma service. One-day sittings at the Bay Area halls are often conducted by an assistant teacher, who is available for questions during noon interviews.
