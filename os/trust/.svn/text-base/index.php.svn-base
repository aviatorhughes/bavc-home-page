<p>The Bay Area Vipassana Trust organizes children’s courses and old student activities in the San Francisco Bay Area. One-hour sittings, three-hour sittings, one-day courses, service opportunities and trust meetings take place at homes of old students, two halls and other facilities in San Francisco, Berkeley, Santa Clara, and neighboring towns. The activities and halls are staffed and supported by grateful old students on a volunteer basis.</p>

<p>The Bay Area Vipassana Trust (BAVT) was formed in early 2014. In addition to being a hub for Bay Area old student courses and dhamma halls, it oversees the organization of the annual non-center 10 day course held over winter holidays in Occidental, CA. It also is the hub for NACCC and Bay Area children’s courses. Lastly, but importantly, it will also be responsible for a dhamma center in the Bay Area if one is developed.</p>
<br />

<p>Committees on the trust include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finance Committee</li>
  <li>Outreach Committee</li>
  <li>Center Search Committee</li>
  <li>Childrens’ Courses Committee</li>
  <li>North American Children’s Course Community Committee</li>
  <li>South Bay Vipassana Hall Committee</li>
  <li>East Bay Vipassana Hall Committee</li>
  <li>CYO (non-center course) Committee</li>
</ul>
<br />

<p>Trust meetings take place approximately every 2-3 months at a Bay Area location.  All old students are welcome to attend and observe trust meetings.  There are many opportunities to support committees and trust activities without becoming a trust member.  To learn about trust meetings times and locations, please view the <a href="/os/events/">Group Sittings and Events</a> page.</p>
