<h2>Bay Area Vipassana Center Trust Meetings Schedule</h2>
<br>

Trust meetings are held at South Bay and East Bay Vipassana Halls in Bay Area. They last typically about one to two hours. They are  preceded by a one hour group sitting and it is recommended that those attending the meeting sit prior.  All old students are welcome to attend.  Perhaps you'd like to listen to committee reports, find out who's who for various projects, give suggestions, or volunteer for an activity. Attending a trust meeting is an excellent way to find out how Bay Area Vipassana Trust really runs.
