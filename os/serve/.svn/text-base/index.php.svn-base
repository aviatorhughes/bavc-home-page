<h2>Meditation and Dhamma Service</h2>
<br />
<p><u>Meditation</u> and <u>Dhamma Service</u> are like two wings of a bird or two wheels of a cart. For one to progress in Dhamma, both need to be of the same size and strength. The giving of Dhamma Service, whether in a course or in some other way to help in the spread of Dhamma, is one of the most valuable experiences a student of Vipassana can have.</p>
<br />

<h2>Why Give Dhamma Service?</h2>
<br />
<p>The Bay Area Vipassana activities, including the East Bay Vipassana and South Bay Vipassana Halls, children’s courses, and a large annual off-center course in Occidental, California, are managed by old student volunteers like you. As students benefit from their own practice, the volition to see others benefit arises. This is how these facilities are able to exist - with the enthusiasm and dedication of old students. Many students continue to find that serving is an excellent way to deepen their practice and learn how to apply Vipassana in daily life.</p>
<br />

<h2>Committees</h2>
<br />
<p>Much of the planning and oversight of Vipassana activities in the Bay Area is done by old students working on committees. These include Finance, CYO Course, Outreach, and Children’s Committee. All old students are welcome to join committees. Please contact attend the next trust meeting to learn more.</p>
<br/>

<h2>Trust Meetings</h2>
<br />
<p>Trust meetings include an AT-led group sitting followed by a 2-hour BAVC Trust meeting. All old students are welcome to attend the group sitting and/or trust meeting.  Please see the <a href="/os/events">calendar</a> for upcoming trust meeting dates.</p>
