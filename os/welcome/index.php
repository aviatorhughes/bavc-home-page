<h2>Welcome</h2>
You might have reached this page following the completion of a Vipassana meditation course
 at the CYO site in Occidental, CA. If this was your first course, we would like to welcome
 you now as a fellow old student and let you know of the various supports for maintaining
 your practice.
<br/>
<br/> A Vipassana course is truly valuable only if it makes a change in your life, 
 and a change will come only if you keep practicing the technique on a daily basis. 
 This <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/en/os/osguide.htm" target="_blank">brief outline of what you have
  learned</a> is offered with best wishes for your continued success in meditation.<br/><br/>

<b>DHAMMA SERVICE</b><br>
It is old students like you who make it possible for hundreds of new students each year to benefit from Vipassana meditation as you did. To apply to serve on a course you can access the service application through the schedule page on each meditation center’s website.<br><br>

Please note that it is possible to serve any part of a 10-day course depending on space availability. Priority is given to full-time servers.<br><br>

Many students find that giving Dhamma service results in the strengthening of their own practice. Ways one can serve are described at:
<a href="http://www.manda.dhamma.org/old/WaysToServe.html">http://www.manda.dhamma.org/old/WaysToServe.html</a>
<br><br>
For inquiries specific to Occidental course, please write to <a href="info@sfbayarea.us.dhamma.org">info@sfbayarea.us.dhamma.org</a> or call us at (631)-629-6734.<br>

We encourage you to establish your daily practice, which is the key to success. 
We hope this information will support you in your efforts. Please let us know if you have any questions.<br/><br/>
